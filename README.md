JS bookmarklet for crazy scrolling action!

This is a small experiment that uses JavaScript to add a couple of CSS3-properties to various elements on the current page. When the user scrolls, those elements will start to rotate.

Instructions
------------
1. Create a new bookmark in your web browser (IE less than 10 will not work) and give it a suitable name
2. Open bookmarklet.txt and paste its content into the field that corresponds to the bookmark URL (it's typically called "web address", "location" or something similar)
3. Try it out! Just visit some website and click the bookmark you just created!

And don't worry; the bookmarklet is only active on the current page view, it won't stick around on reload.

Compatibility
-------------
Should work fine with all Evergreen browsers.
